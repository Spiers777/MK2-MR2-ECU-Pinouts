## MR2 ECU Pinouts
I struggled to find these pinouts in a concise format easy to access location, so i have compiled and shared it here.

## Rev1 & Rev2 JDM & UK
89661-172310.pdf - Rev1 UK spec ECU - Pinout from ECU off my car before going to Rev3 Management

89661-17280.pdf - JDM Rev1 ECU (180kmh speed limiter) - [Found on an Australian Forum](https://www.toymods.org.au/forums/threads/60816-SW20-jdm-3sge-pinout-WHAT!-No-G-pin-(D8-or-D-instead)-huh-updated-with-pics/page2)

It seems Rev1 and Rev2 ECUs share the same pinout, has been mentioned previously Rev1/2 UK/JDM ECUs are interchangeable

## Rev3 UK
89661-17500 - Rev3 UK spec ECU - [Found on Woodsport Forum](https://www.woodsport.org/forum/showthread.php?19150-MK2-ECU-Questions)
